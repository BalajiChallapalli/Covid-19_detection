**Overview**
This project aims to develop a system for detecting COVID-19 infections using supervised learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The system will analyze medical data to accurately identify whether an individual is infected with COVID-19.

**How It Works**
Data Collection: Gather patient data, including symptoms, medical history, and test results.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis, handling missing values and normalizing features.
Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features that contribute to the detection of COVID-19.

**Model Training:**
**Logistic Regression:** A statistical method that models the probability of a binary outcome, such as the presence or absence of COVID-19.

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A non-parametric algorithm that classifies a case based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors.

Model Evaluation: Test the models using a separate dataset to evaluate their performance and accuracy.
Prediction and Detection: Use the trained models to predict COVID-19 infection in new patients based on their medical data.

**Benefits**
Timely and Accurate Diagnosis: Helps in the early detection of COVID-19, leading to timely medical intervention.
Reliable: Employs robust supervised learning techniques to ensure reliable results.
Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for extensive testing by providing preliminary diagnostic support.
This project will enhance the ability of healthcare providers to detect COVID-19 infections accurately and efficiently, leveraging the power of supervised learning techniques to support medical decision-making.
